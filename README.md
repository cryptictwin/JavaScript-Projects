variable = A container that stores a value.
            Behaves as if it were the value it contains.

1. declaration      let x;
2. assignment       x = 100;



Arithmetic operators = operands (values, variables, etc)
                       operators (+ - * /) 

Augmented assignment operators: (students = students + 1)
                                = (students += 1)

To increase a variable by only 1: (student++)
            or subtract by only 1: (student--)
