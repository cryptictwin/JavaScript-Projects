Arithmetic operators = operands (values, variables, etc)
                       operators (+ - * /) 

Augmented assignment operators: (students = students + 1)
                                = (students += 1)

To increase a variable by only 1: (student++)
            or subtract by only 1: (student--)


IF STATEMENTS = if a condition is true, execute some code
                if not, do something else


.checked = property that determines the checked state of an
           HTML checkbox or radio button element



 ternary operator = a shortcut to if{} and else{} statements
                    helps to assign a variable based on a condition
                    condtion ? codeIfTrue : codeIfFalse
let age = 21;
let message = age >= 18 ? "You're and adult" : "You're a minor";
